  excerpt:
    "Meaning isn’t something we stumble upon—it’s something we build. Through effort, intention, and a belief in our own agency, the ordinary actions of daily life can become deeply significant.",
  content: `
Statement: Meaning isn’t discovered; rather, it’s created.

I have found myself, like many others, struggling with the notion of meaning, fulfillment, happiness—whatever you’d like to call it. And I could never get good, centralized feedback on how to bridge this gap in my life. In the following anecdotes, I’ll share my story and some heuristics that have helped me throughout my life.

1. More effort almost always yields better outcomes

Growing up, I never thought I was the smartest kid; I did think, however, that I put a lot of effort into whatever I set my mind to. Somewhere along the way, though, I realized that the opposite was true: intelligence didn’t matter anywhere near as much as the effort I put in—which, at times, was very little.

As a side note, I also think that nonchalance in today’s society is horrible. People should care about their relationships with others and about their passions, interests, and hobbies. Effort is cool, and it always will be—at least to me. I’ll always be the one to put in more if need be.

2. Manifestation / visualization

Whether it’s NBA superstars or practicing physicians, I consistently hear successful people use manifestation and/or visualization to help them realize their goals.

For me, it looks like this: if you are able to conceptualize the beginning of whatever story you are tackling, along with the end, you’ve already completed over half the battle. Filling out the in-between portion is just a matter of putting your head down and making things happen until enough time has passed and you’re done.

3. Personal identity

The two most important questions in life, to me, are: 1) Who am I? (What systems and heuristics work best for me? What do I derive pleasure from? What do I enjoy doing?) and 2) Where am I going? (What do I want?) Similar to the previous point, I think that not enough people spend enough time thinking deeply about what they want—whether it be in the short or long term. Once this is nailed down, again, making it happen is easy.

Additionally, something that has helped me, which I derived from a hiring assessment, is understanding the difference between how you view yourself versus how you think others view you. This delta says a lot about our personality—not necessarily in a good or bad way, but in a way that can be helpful.

4. Deconstruction

Being a student made it seem to me as though the world was very systematic and driven by a very specific set of rules—which can be true to some extent, but not entirely so. Understanding that there are no “rules” or objective truths can be freeing. An example from my college philosophy class: Hume said that just because something’s always happened before—like a ball falling due to gravity—doesn’t mean it must happen again; our belief that it will is habit, not logic.

Ultimately, perception is reality, and we should adopt systems and heuristics that make it easier to live our day-to-day lives.

5. Internal locus of control

I like thinking about the world in terms of fate, luck, or destiny to some degree. However, it is much more helpful to have an internal locus of control—adhering to the notion that our actions determine outcomes in our lives rather than determinism. It is essentially to say that we should hold the notion of free will dear to our hearts, and perhaps that is because…

What we ultimately want is agency—the feeling that I meaningfully exist, that I have influence over my life.

I want to feel as though I am acting on the world rather than the world acting on me.

In this way, our seemingly insignificant little actions, words, and decisions become meaningful.

At least, they have for me in my own lived experience.

  title: "A Rejection of Locke's Memory Theory of Personal Identity",
  subtitle: "PHIL 126 Essay",
  date: "April 2019",
  excerpt:
    "In writing An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke argues that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for personal identity—and that we should not be punished for actions we do not remember committing.",
  content: `1   Introduction

In writing An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, John Locke details his account of self and personal identity over time. He argues that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition of personal identity, and that one should not be punished for performing an action that person does not recall having performed, for they are not the same person as the one who committed the action. In this paper, I will argue that Locke's argument ultimately fails due to his mistaken view that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for personal identity.'
  
I will begin by examining the notion of personal identity and Locke's view on the topic. His argument that memory is necessary and sufficient for sameness of person, along with its implications for moral responsibility, will be analyzed, followed by why this argument fails due to his mistaken view that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for personal identity. Finally, I will consider and discuss a potential objection to this counterargument.
  
2   Locke's Memory Theory of Personal Identity
  
In his work, Locke argues that personal identity is a matter of memory continuity, which consists of one's ability to remember past thoughts and actions as their own. As a result, one should not be punished for performing an action that person does not recall having performed, for they are not the same person as the one who committed the action. I will examine how he arrives at this conclusion in the following paragraphs.
  
To begin, Locke defines a person as a “thinking intelligent being that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places” (2.27.9). He takes consciousness to be the perception of what passes in one's mind, and believes it to be inseparable from and essential to thinking, for it is impossible for one to perceive without perceiving that one is perceiving. Since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and one must be a thinking being in order to be a person, he argues that the person with which one identifies with extends only as far back as one's consciousness does. Rather than being dependent on the continuity of a material substance such as the body, or an immaterial substance such as the mind, personal identity is solely grounded in this consciousness, or the sameness of a rational being. Any change in consciousness signifies a change in personal identity, and any change in personal identity implies that this consciousness has changed. Locke suggests that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for sameness of consciousness, leading to the conclusion that two persons are the same if, and only if, one can remember the other's thoughts and actions. If one can remember committing some action, one in fact committed it. Conversely, if one cannot remember committing some action, then one did not commit it.
  
Locke goes on to define “person” as a forensic term, appropriating actions and their merit. When considering an action, I can see that I will be the same person in the future who will be punished for the actions I choose to commit now. When being punished in the future, I can reflect on the past and see that I am the same person who committed the action for which I am being punished. However, if I cannot remember committing an action, there has been a change in consciousness that signifies a change in personal identity. Thus, I cannot be morally responsible for an action I do not remember committing, for I am a different person and, accordingly, should not be punished for it.
  
3   Refutation of Locke's Memory Theory of Personal Identity
  
Locke's memory theory for personal identity ultimately fails due to his mistaken view that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for sameness of person. In the following paragraphs, I will show that Locke's point of view leads to a contradiction.
  
Let us consider Thomas Reid's objection: “Suppose a brave officer to have been flogged when a boy at school for robbing an orchard, to have taken a standard from the enemy in his first campaign, and to have been made a general in advanced life; suppose, also, which must be admitted to be possible, that, when he took the standard, he was conscious of his having been flogged at school, and that, when made a general, he was conscious of his taking the standard, but had absolutely lost the consciousness of his flogging. These things being supposed, it follows, from Mr. Locke's doctrine, that he who was flogged at school is the same person who took the standard, and that he who took the standard is the same person who was made a general. Whence it follows, if there be any truth in logic, that the general is the same person with him who was flogged at school. But the general's consciousness does not reach so far back as his flogging; therefore, according to Mr. Locke's doctrine, he is not the person who was flogged. Therefore, the general is, and at the same time is not, the same person with him who was flogged at school.”
  
According to Locke's memory theory, memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for sameness of person. By this line of reasoning, if a person at a time T2 episodically remembers an experience that occurred at a time T1, then the person at T2 is the same as the person at T1. On the other hand, we can apply the law of transitivity to identity, for everything is identical to itself, wherein if A is identical to B and B is identical to C, then C is identical to A. If the officer recalls being flogged as a boy, then the officer is the same person as the boy. In addition, if the general recalls taking the standard as an officer, then the general is the same person as the officer. Finally, if the general is the same person as the officer, and the officer is the same person as the boy, then the general is the same person as the boy. However, given that memory is a necessary condition for sameness of person, Locke's memory theory leads to the conclusion that the general is not the same person as the boy, for he does not recall being flogged at school. Meanwhile, the law of transitivity demonstrates that the general is in fact the same person as the boy, thus leading to a contradiction. Identity is transitive, but memory continuity is not.
  
As a result, it is clear that memory is neither necessary nor sufficient for personal identity. I can suppose that memory is not a necessary condition, for I have experienced many events that I do not recall. It is true that only I can recall my experiences, but it is not my memory of an experience that makes it mine. Rather, an experience is mine because it is already mine by virtue of the fact that I did in fact experience it. Memory is also not a sufficient condition, for the concept of remembering contains within itself the characteristic that only I can remember my experiences. For me to remember committing an action is to remember myself committing it. To demonstrate this point, suppose we want to know if Jennifer, who exists at a time T2, is the same person as Michael, who we know to have existed at a time T1. Locke's memory theory of personal identity states that Jennifer is Michael if, and only if, Jennifer can recall Michael's past thoughts and actions. However, Jennifer's ability to recall one of Michael's past experiences can only be verified to be a genuine memory if Jennifer is in fact the same person as Michael, so we must know beforehand whether or not Jennifer is the same person as Michael before we can apply Locke's memory theory. Thus, it is circular reasoning and trivial to say that sameness of person is based on the concept of remembering, that memory continuity is sufficient for personal identity.
  
4   Potential Objection
  
I will now consider a potential objection to this counterargument. Perhaps Locke may offer a modification to his memory theory of personal identity that successfully avoids Reid's brave officer paradox. Such an objection is that a series of total temporary states belonging to a person preserves memory as a necessary and sufficient condition for sameness of person.
  
In response to this counterargument, Locke may adopt an amendment similar to the one that H.P. Grice proposes in his essay Personal Identity. Here, Grice introduces the term total temporary state (t.t.s.), which is “composed of all the experiences any one person is having at any given time.” He goes on to state that “in a series of total temporary states belonging to one person, every t.t.s. which is a member of that series will contain as an element a memory of some experience which is an element in the temporally preceding member of the series; in a series of total temporary states not belonging to one person this will not be the case.”
  
Such a modification preserves memory as a necessary and sufficient condition for personal identity, while also accounting for the transitive nature of identity. Memory is a necessary condition in that an element of a remembered experience is contained in at least one t.t.s. in the stream of total temporary states belonging to a person. The brave officer paradox is resolved, as the t.t.s. of the general contains in it an element also contained in the t.t.s. of the officer, and the t.t.s. of the officer contains in it an element also contained in the t.t.s. of the boy. That is to say this series of total temporary states belongs to one person, leading to the conclusion that the general is in fact the same person as the boy, even if he does not recall being flogged at school. Memory is also a sufficient condition in that the total temporary states in a stream belonging to a person share a transitive element: transitivity of total temporary states will fail if the states in question do not in fact belong to the same person. Similarly, this revised theory also holds true against false memories: mistakenly recalling have experienced an event is not equal to actually having experienced it. Thus, the series of total temporary states belonging to one person would not contain their false memories.
  
Locke would likely change his stance on the moral scenario, too: even if I cannot recall committing an action, an element of that remembered experience is contained in at least one t.t.s. in my stream of total temporary states. Therefore, I am morally responsible for an action I do not recall committing, for I am the same person and, accordingly, should be punished for it.
  
In response to this objection, the revised theory still falls short in defining what exactly constitutes sameness of person, just as Locke's original memory theory does. Rather than viewing personal identity as a substance in itself, it adopts a view similar to that of Hume, wherein persons are “nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions.” However, it succeeds in maintaining memory as a necessary and sufficient condition of personal identity, while also avoiding contradictions that arise when considering the transitivity of identity. As a result, it is sufficient in supporting Locke's point of view.
  
5   Conclusion
  
In this paper, I argued that Locke's memory theory of personal identity ultimately fails due to his mistaken view that memory is a necessary and sufficient condition for personal identity. This was realized by identifying contradictions that arise when considering the transitivity of identity. One could make an objection to my claim by modifying the original theory to account for a series of total temporary states belonging to a person that preserves memory as a necessary and sufficient condition. However, this objection still falls short in defining what exactly constitutes sameness of person, but is sufficient in supporting Locke's point of view.

    title: "The Dead Shall Be Praised",
    subtitle: "ENGL 120 Essay",
    date: "November 2018",
    excerpt:
      "Grove Street Cemetery's Egyptian pylon bears the inscription “THE DEAD SHALL BE RAISED.” Inside, New Haven's first chartered burial ground reframes death, memory, and the desire for permanence.",
    content: `The looming gateway to Grove Street Cemetery faces High Street. Inscribed on the lintel reads, “THE DEAD SHALL BE RAISED,” (1 Corinthians 15:52) to which Yale President Arthur Twining Hadley supposedly responded, “They certainly will be, if Yale needs the property.”

Architects Henry Austin and Hezekiah Augur designed this brownstone ancient Egyptian pylon during a wave of Egyptian Revival architecture that flourished from 1820-1850. In ancient Egypt, the two monumental towers on either side of the columns represented the hills between which the sun rose and set. While it's uncertain whether Austin and Augur knew of this, they nevertheless chose a symbol of eternal renewal and resurrection to mark the entrance.

Prior to the establishment of Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven residents buried their dead on the Green, the central block of the town's nine-square settlement plan. This changed when severe yellow fever epidemics devastated the city in 1794 and 1795: with almost five thousand buried over the past one hundred fifty years, the Green was much too crowded for any more skeletal occupants. New Haven residents and U.S. Senator James Hillhouse planned out a new graveyard on farmland to the north and two years later, Connecticut officially incorporated The New Burying Ground.

Over two hundred years later, the commotion of a bustling city and large university contrast the aura of peace coming from within the cemetery. An eight-foot brownstone wall surrounds three sides of the graveyard and obstructs everything from view, save a few trees and the most massive of headstones. Should you venture down Grove Street, a wrought iron fence provides a view into the graveyard. Immediately beyond the entrance lies a brick Victorian office topped with steep roofs that once served as a chapel so that service could be held in inclement weather; its sole decoration is a gilded butterfly symbolizing the soul's release from the body.

The cemetery greets me through its vast scale, with a seemingly infinite number of gray headstones populating the whopping eighteen acres. The grass is neatly trimmed and ancient oak trees shade the paths, which are wide enough for cars or horse-drawn carriages to pass through. Each road is named after a tree: Maple, Magnolia, and Cedar Avenue are each lined with their titular species – Hillhouse prized trees and initiated the extensive plantings that would give New Haven the nickname of “Elm City.”

As I look beyond the wall, buildings like the Center for Innovation and Design, Benjamin Franklin College, and Yale Health provide a refreshing contrast of color and style to the graveyard's beautiful, albeit monotonous green and gray. American flags honor veterans' headstones and wilting flowers adorn the walkways. A low hum can be heard in the distance as two men work diligently on maintaining the property amidst freezing temperatures; another man can be seen sitting alone in front of a grave marker, slowly taking drags of his cigarette.

One tourist carries a DSLR camera and takes photos of the headstones. “I'm actually from Ireland – my wife left to go shopping but I thought this place looked more interesting. It's very beautiful, I was just looking at the different ethnicities in the names.” His name is Killian, and he snaps a photo of me before we part ways. Another older visitor dressed in a suit strolls around with his daughter. I ask him why he's here, to which he responds, “It's very peaceful. Graveyards are a place for introspection and reflection – we're all going to end up in one, or something like it, one day.” As I listen to birds chirping freely, I agree with his sentiment.

The very notion of a cemetery, not just the first chartered burial ground in the United States, is revolutionary in itself. Some tens of thousands of years ago, humans stumbled upon the dual emergence of symbols and sentience due to the increasing complexity and growth of the brain, coupled with vocal cords. With these tools came the development of language and eventually, the creation of a symbolic reality. Mortuary rituals fit into this newfound ability to reminisce about the past and envision the future, to collaborate and think abstractly. Although there is no way for anthropologists to research language in this regard, graveyards leave behind a literal fossil to study.

Burials reflect a deeply spiritual and meaningful aspect of humans mourning past deaths and imagining their own in the future. And for a long time, deliberate interment was thought to be a practice unique to Homo sapiens, one of many factors seeming to distinguish us from other animals. However, fossils discovered in 2013 evidenced that Homo naledi also carried out burials, even though their brains were half as small as ours. Pinpointing what exactly separates us from the rest of nature is surprisingly difficult.

As the first private nonprofit cemetery in the world, Grove Street Cemetery redefined graveyards from the ground down. Whereas bodies used to be thrown into the ground wherever space was available, sections of the cemetery were allocated for certain families. Beyond this, land was specifically designated for church parishioners, out of town strangers, the indigent, persons of color, and Yale College.

These divisions become immediately apparent when touring the area. Plots like Number 2 Cedar Avenue are enclosed by an iron fence and host the family of Benjamin Silliman, a prominent American chemist and Yalie. Luminaries such as Roger Sherman, Noah Webster, and Eli Whitney exhibit well-crafted, elegant headstones; lofty obelisks seem to reach for the heavens, continuing the Egyptian motif found in the pylon.

On the other hand, comparatively tiny stone grave markers moved from the Green can be found lined up against the back wall in alphabetical order. No bigger than 2' x 1', they are the oldest relics that can be found here, dating back to the seventeenth century. Wear and tear has rendered some illegible, and one looks more like a rock than an ornament. Another simply reads, “IH AGE 79 1683,” in what could pass for a child's handwriting, with the word AGE sloping diagonally to avoid running out of space. Inscriptions recall the deaths of everyone from 5-week-old William to 93-year-old Decon.

Stone obviously isn't permanent, but on the scale of a human life, it is – our lives are too short for us to perceive the constant movement of plate tectonics and mountains eroding. Consequently, we build monuments like the Great Pyramids and carve statues out of stone because they will outlast us, effectively achieving immortality. Modern constructions of metal and glass are nothing more than stone refined through human ingenuity – collectively, they anchor a sense of continuity and permanence, the kind that we wish for ourselves. One headstone reads, “We all yearn for transcendence, for immortal life, to be part of the future.”

Looking at the grave markers, I realize their decay aligns with the enduring truth that like humans, stone is transitory. According to estimates by demographic researchers at the Population Reference Bureau, roughly 100 billion people have died before us. Yet, death stalks us in a trivial, ignorable way: an expiration date far in the future engenders a false sense of permanence and lulls us into complacency. There is always tomorrow, so why start today?

The opposite idea, that our days are numbered, is emboldening. Although failures and humiliations will be forgotten, great achievements may not. As I leave, I find a bench marked with the words of Pericles: “What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.” From the fallen soldiers to the fourteen Yale presidents who lie here, the people interred at Grove Street Cemetery are immortal in this sense.

I have never seen leaves change color first-hand. I have seen red and orange leaves while traveling, but green leaves are a constant in my mind, like stone. Yet, for the first time, I am seeing the leaves change color in the cemetery.`,

    title: "The Lessons We Take from Obstacles",
    subtitle: "Common App",
    date: "November 2017",
    excerpt:
      "For eight glacially slow minutes, we performed our skit, featuring everything from pneumatic wings to a fully functional go-kart built from scratch. It was our fifth time at World Finals and in that stadium, all I could think about was how bizarre it was to watch your work blow up in front of you, literally.",
    content: `I embarked on my venture with Odyssey of the Mind (OM) when I was in first grade. Alongside six teammates, I harbored a certain naiveté that made the whole experience seem more like glorified playtime than a creative problem-solving competition. We worked as diligently as our sub-four-foot-tall bodies would enable us and struggled to work with anything that weighed more than five pounds. Power tools were undoubtedly off limits per our parents' safety concerns, not that our juvenile hands could handle them anyway.

Over the years, we fashioned elaborate solutions to quirky challenges, producing a diverse selection of vehicles that could catalyze chemical reactions or disassemble and reassemble: a bootleg Transformers of sorts. I felt fiery nuts of steel drop into my lap and burn holes through my dearest pair of navy blue Nike basketball shorts. Neodymium magnets worked in tandem with rat traps to crush my hands: all part of the learning process. Whereas I had once been shy and trembled at the snap of dinky mousetraps, I now found myself featuring as a rapping grandma in our music videos and adrenalized to sit on exploding boxes.

My sophomore year marked the team's tenth anniversary: only three of the seven original team members remained, myself included, and whether or not to continue was a legitimate question. After collectively agreeing to another year, Home Depot became my third home again, right behind the coach's. Weekends meant OM work marathons wherein I could spend four hours testing the viability of a solution to meet problem limitations, just to spectacularly fail in a matter of seconds.

The engineering component of OM had largely been handled by my best friend and me every year, and this time was no different. Without a doubt, the single large car was the most difficult element of the problem we chose. I applied what little physics knowledge I possessed to get the job done; pressurized air tanks blew up in our faces and batteries shorted, but we eventually achieved our final product. The car worked in sync with an imaginative storyline to win us first place at the regional and state tournament, the latter of which would take us to Iowa for World Finals.

Even in the minutes leading up to the finale, our vehicle displayed undying loyalty to Murphy's law: the batteries exploded and set off the fire alarm, leaving bystanders stuck in the elevator and us with nothing but the ultimate stress test. After hurriedly repairing the flaming car, we came, we saw, but failed to conquer, placing eleventh overall. It was utter disillusionment to see that hundreds of hours of work was nothing but charcoal, crumbling into a pile of ashes rather than the diamond we had hoped to produce. I could all but hear the world laughing in my face, saying, "Your best wasn't good enough!"

Although blunt and severe, the realization that I couldn't have done better was liberating: in the face of the universe's stubborn silence, words like "deserve" and "fair" become indistinct – all we can do is constantly strive for something better. And there is real meaning and value to be created by pursuing projects in spite of, rather than because of incentives. Over the past decade, working with everything from amphibious cars to a makeshift eighty-gallon water trough shaped us into calculating risk-takers, ready to adapt to whatever challenge the future had to offer.

We returned to World Finals the following year to place second overall, and I still wear those navy blue shorts today.`,
